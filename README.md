# Navigation with Graphs

## Introduction

This project demonstrates navigation and pathfinding using graph algorithms in Python. It focuses on implementing various graph traversal techniques to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which can be applied to real-world navigation problems. The project also includes features for placing different agents at various positions on the map and using keys to add or block paths dynamically.
